While the size, color, and exact shape of these relatively tame carnivores vary based on their ecosystem, they all have one thing in common: symbiotic relationships with other creatures. A giant pipefish has a fragile, tubular form that ends in a thin, sharp feeding tube. It relies on filter feeders, scavengers, and other hangers-on to attach themselves to its cylindrical body and to provide physical protection against predators and other threats; in exchange, the riders get a free meal out of the pipefish’s constant movement (in the case of filter feeders) or scraps (in the case of scavengers). Convincing a giant pipefish that you’re a friend and not just another meal is no easy feat; the DC of Survival checks to bond with a giant pipefish companion is 3 higher than normal.",

Careful control over what and how much the beast eats helps keep them in their docile grazing cycle and suppresses their combustible death throes as well. Most cloud rays bond to a single master, becoming notoriously difficult with new riders. Cloud rays can flourish on almost any gas giant, and domesticated rays can even survive in the skies above terrestrial worlds with proper supplements.",

However, sometimes a zernivian’s ability to inhabit a host goes awry, and the creature is permanently trapped inside that host. When this happens, the physiologies of the zernivian and its host combine and mutate. Perhaps realizing it can no longer find prey without help, the zernivian becomes more amenable to other species.
