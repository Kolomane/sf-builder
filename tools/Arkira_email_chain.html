                        <p><strong>From:</strong> Arkira &lt;arkira@ceiba.com&gt;<br>
                            <strong>To:</strong> Dr. Zara Venari &lt;zvenari@ceiba.com&gt;
                        </p>
                        <p>Dear Dr. Venari,</p>
                        <p>I hope this message find you well. A few days ago you asked me to help secure funding for your department's growing needs. My attempts have been unfruitful. The balance for your department's funding is a few days away from going in the negatives. I took the initiative to self-audit your department's spend, and even consulted a colleague, a hive mate of mine, that works within the Internal Purchasing Audit Department (IPAD).
                        </p>
                        <p>We were unable to find any discrepancies. It appears your department is on-track with all projects and plans. The new projects you proposed, within our change-freeze window, were not in scope for this fiscal year and will need to be delayed until next year.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, I couldn't help but to notice that Project 644, Project XII, and Project Eight were catastrophic failures. Project 644 was for a new residential building on the outskirts of Korinthia; this project was delayed indefinitely since construction with the new, expiremental, Ceiba-branded nanite-infused foundation polluted the surrounding area's soil, water, air, and trees. This seeped into a small hive of Formians underground causing them to evacuate and close off those tunnels, which was the branch of a major tunnel-way; subsequently, fourteen other hives were impacted from the toxic, and currently closed, trade-route.
                        </p>
                        <p>Project XII was for a Ceiba-branded ship design; the omega prototype was testing autonomy and efficiency by traveling from Korinthia to Qabarat and back unmanned. The ship lost comms, autopilot, and power (in that order) causing it to veer off course and crash into the Bulwarks. The ship was primarily carrying backup fuel, in the event it was not as efficient as testing on Sovyrian led to believe. Korinthia is still trying to "make-good" with Qabarat, Asana, and The Colonies. The forest fire spread to Nestwall Mountains and polluted the air within the colonies for days.</p>
                        <p>Project Eight was an experimental fuel, which there was only a small amount onboard Project XII Omega. This is still burning, two months after the incident, causing residents to evacuate the Bulwarks.</p>
                        <p>The financial analyst in me suggests we can receive kick-backs for these failed research expenditures, which would in turn allocate funding for the projects requested. The Formian in me is upset with these travesties, and wants to pass it off to another FAA due to my inherent bias.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,<br><br>
                            Arkira<br>

                        <p><b class="text-danger">NEGATIVITY IN YOUR EMAIL WAS DETECTED.</b></p>
                        <p>DR. VENARI HAS BEEN MADE AWARE OF YOUR DISCREPANCY AND BOTH OF YOU HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER IN PHYSICAL FORM.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for your continued support.</p>
                        <p>Best regards,<br><br>

                        <p><strong>From:</strong> Dr. Zara Venari &lt;zvenari@ceiba.com&gt;<br>
                            <strong>To:</strong> Arkira &lt;arkira@ceiba.com&gt;
                        </p>
                        <p>Arkira,</p>
                        <p>I am aware of the financial situation of my department. I told you to make something work. You will make it work.<br>I did not ask for your audit and project management expertise, rather I asked for your assistance in securing the financing required to continue with the next projects.</p>
                        <p>The failed projects of this year will be revisited shortly; the funding from the unfortunate disasters will go into better engineering, better safety, and a better Castrovel.<br>If you check the department accounts, you will find they are adequately funded, and <b>have been</b> adequately funded. We have not, nor ever will be, over-spending capital we do not have. I suggest you double-check your work before presenting me with accusations and untruthful statements about our financial status, Arkira.</p>
                        <p>My automated response has scheduled a meeting for us. Attendance is required. We can also talk about your request to transition from Contingency to Contractor.<br>You are on a great path to success, Arkira.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, I would like to personally extend an invitation to join me and a few others to Komena, and then Chisk. We have an amazing opportunity to speak to and help the residents that were directly, negatively impacted by our department. You seem rather invested in the cause, and I would want nothing more than a diverse cast alongside me to aid me and further expand our relationships with the locals.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for your patience and cooperation.<br><br>Best regards,<br>
                            Dr. Zara Venari<br>
